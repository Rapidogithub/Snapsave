## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. **"File upload section not showing"**

**Problem**: After selecting "Photo" or "Video", you don't see where to upload files.

**Solution**: 
- Make sure you've selected a content type from the dropdown
- Check browser console (F12) for any JavaScript errors
- The file upload section should appear below the dropdown

**What you should see**:
- A "üìÅ Choose File to Upload:" label
- A file input button
- A preview area with upload icon

### 2. **"Database not set up" error**

**Problem**: App shows "Database not set up" notification.

**Solution**:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database-setup.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute all commands

### 3. **"Failed to save content" error**

**Problem**: Files or content won't save.

**Solution**:

   - Create bucket named `snapsave-files`
   - Make it **Public**

2. **Check storage policies**:

   - Supabase has file size limits
   - Try with a smaller file first

### 4. **"No content found" when accessing**

**Problem**: Entering password shows no content.

**Solution**:
- Make sure you're using the same 2-digit password you used when saving
- Check that content was saved successfully (should show success message)
- Try saving new content first, then access it

### 5. **App not loading properly**

**Problem**: Page shows errors or doesn't work.

**Solution**:
1. **Check Supabase credentials**:
   - Open `script.js`

   - Should look like: `https://your-project.supabase.co`
